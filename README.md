# django-restaurant

This is a restaurant website created as a portfolio to demonstrate my coding skills to potential employers for the purpose of getting a job. In this site, people can order the food from home and get a reservation in advance. Also, it has a comment sections where the users can leave their comments. Here also has a contact section where interested people can make contact and also has an about us section.
